				"abstractText": "Free fatty acids are basic oleochemicals implemented in a range of applications including surfactants, lubricants, paints, plastics, and cosmetics. Microbial fatty acid biosynthesis has gained much attention as it provides a sustainable alternative for petrol- and plant oil-derived chemicals. The yeast Starmerella bombicola is a microbial cell factory that naturally employs its powerful lipid metabolism for the production of the biodetergents sophorolipids (&gt;&thinsp;300&nbsp;g/L). However, in this study we exploit the lipidic potential of S. bombicola and convert it from the glycolipid production platform into a free fatty acid cell factory. We used several metabolic engineering strategies to promote extracellular fatty acid accumulation which include blocking competing pathways (sophorolipid biosynthesis and &beta;-oxidation) and preventing free fatty acid activation. The best producing mutant (&Delta;cyp52m1&Delta;faa1&Delta;mfe2) secreted 0.933&nbsp;g/L (&plusmn;&thinsp;0.04) free fatty acids with a majority of C18:1 (43.8%) followed by C18:0 and C16:0 (40.0 and 13.2%, respectively). Interestingly, deletion of SbFaa1 in a strain still producing sophorolipids also resulted in 25% increased de novo sophorolipid synthesis (P&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.0089) and when oil was supplemented to the same strain, a 50% increase in sophorolipid production was observed compared to the wild type (P&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.03). We believe that our work is pivotal for the further development and exploration of S. bombicola as a platform for synthesis of environmentally friendly oleochemicals.",

				"abstractText": "Clostridium has great potential in industrial application and medical research. But low DNA repair capacity and plasmids transformation efficiency severely delayed development and application of genetic tools based on homologous recombination (HR). TargeTron is a gene editing technique dependent on the mobility of group II introns, rather than homologous recombination, which made it very suitable for gene disruption of Clostridium. The application of TargeTron technology in Clostridium was academically reported in 2007 and this tool has been introduced in various clostridia as it is easy to operate, time-saving, and reliable. TargeTron has made great progress in solventogenic Clostridium in the aspects of acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation pathway modification, important functional genes identification, and xylose metabolic pathway analysis &amp; reconstruction. In the review, we revisited 12 years' advances of TargeTron technology applicable in solventogenic Clostridium, including its principle, technical characteristics, application and efforts to expand its capabilities, or to avoid potential drawbacks. Some other technologies as putative competitors or collaborators are also discussed. We believe that TargeTron combined with CRISPR/Cas-assisted gene/base editing and gene-expression regulation system will make a better future for clostridial genetic modification.",

However, the existing aptamer-ligand biosensors can only function with non-complementary DNA elements that cannot replicate in growing cells. Here, we construct an aptamer-based synthetic regulatory circuit that can dynamically upregulate and downregulate the expression of target genes in response to the ligand thrombin at transcriptional and translational levels, respectively, and further used this system to dynamically engineer the synthesis of 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL) in Bacillus subtilis. First, we demonstrated the binding of ligand molecule thrombin with the aptamer can induce the unwinding of fully complementary double-stranded DNA. Based on this finding, we constructed a bifunctional gene expression regulatory circuit using ligand thrombin-bound aptamers. The expression of the reporter gene ranged from 0.084- to 48.1-fold. Finally, by using the bifunctional regulatory circuit, we dynamically upregulated the expression of key genes fkp and futC and downregulated the expression of gene purR, resulting in the significant increase of 2'-FL titer from 24.7 to 674 mg/L. Compared with the other pathway-specific dynamic engineering systems, here the constructed aptamer-based regulatory circuit is independent of pathways, and can be generally used to fine-tune gene expression in other microbes.",

				"abstractText": "Background: Oleaginous yeasts are potent hosts for the renewable production of lipids and harbor great potential for derived products, such as biofuels. Several promising processes have been described that produce hydrocarbon drop-in biofuels based on fatty acid decarboxylation and fatty aldehyde decarbonylation. Unfortunately, besides fatty aldehyde toxicity and high reactivity, the most investigated enzyme, aldehyde-deformylating oxygenase, shows unfavorable catalytic properties which hindered high yields in previous metabolic engineering approaches. Results: To demonstrate an alternative alkane production pathway for oleaginous yeasts, we describe the production of diesel-like, odd-chain alkanes and alkenes, by heterologously expressing a recently discovered light-driven oxidase from Chlorella variabilis (CvFAP) in Yarrowia lipolytica. Initial experiments showed that only strains engineered to have an increased pool of free fatty acids were susceptible to sufficient decarboxylation. Providing these strains with glucose and light in a synthetic medium resulted in titers of 10.9&nbsp;mg/L of hydrocarbons. Using custom 3D printed labware for lighting bioreactors, and an automated pulsed glycerol fed-batch strategy, intracellular titers of 58.7&nbsp;mg/L were achieved. The production of odd-numbered alkanes and alkenes with a length of 17 and 15 carbons shown in previous studies could be confirmed. Conclusions: Oleaginous yeasts such as Yarrowia lipolytica can transform renewable resources such as glycerol into fatty acids and lipids. By heterologously expressing a fatty acid photodecarboxylase from the algae Chlorella variabilis hydrocarbons were produced in several scales from microwell plate to 400&nbsp;mL bioreactors. The lighting turned out to be a crucial factor in terms of growth and hydrocarbon production, therefore, the evaluation of different conditions was an important step towards a tailor-made process. In general, the developed bioprocess shows a route t",

				"abstractText": "Quorum sensing (QS)-based dynamic regulation has been widely used as basic tool for fine-tuning gene expression in response to cell density changes without adding expensive inducers. However, most reported QS systems primarily relied on down-regulation rather than up-regulation of gene expression, significantly limiting its potential as a molecular switch to control metabolic flux. To solve this challenge, we developed a bifunctional and modular Phr60-Rap60-Spo0A QS system, based on two native promoters, P abrB (down-regulation by Spo0A-P) and P spoiiA (up-regulation by Spo0A-P). We constructed a library of promoters with different capacities to implement down-regulation and up-regulation by changing the location, number, and sequences of the binding sites for Spo0A-P. The QS system can dynamically balance the relationship between efficient synthesis of the target product and cell growth. Finally, we validated the usefulness of this strategy by dynamic control of menaquinone-7 (MK-7) synthesis in Bacillus subtilis 168, a model Gram-positive bacterium, with the bifunctional Phr60-Rap60-Spo0A quorum sensing system. Our dynamic pathway regulation led to a 40-fold improvement of MK-7 production from 9 to 360 mg/L in shake flasks and 200 mg/L in 15-L bioreactor. Taken together, our bilayer QS system has been successfully integrated with biocatalytic functions to achieve dynamic pathway regulation in B.&nbsp;subtilis 168, which may be extended for use in other microbes to fine-tune gene expression and improve metabolites production.",

Synthetic biology approaches offer the ability to genetically engineer these communities to improve the properties of these fermented foods. Soy sauce is a fermented condiment with a vast global market. Engineering members of the microbial communities responsible for soy sauce fermentation may therefore lead to the development of improved products. One important property is the colour of soy sauce, with recent evidence pointing to a consumer preference for more lightly-coloured soy sauce products for particular dishes.ResultsHere we show that a bacterial member of the natural soy sauce fermentation microbial community, Bacillus, can be engineered to reduce the &lsquo;browning&rsquo; reaction during soy sauce production. We show that two approaches result in &lsquo;de-browning&rsquo;: engineered consumption of xylose, an important precursor in the browning reaction, and engineered degradation of melanoidins, the major brown pigments in soy sauce. Lastly, we show that these two strategies work synergistically using co-cultures to result in enhanced de-browning.ConclusionsOur results demonstrate the potential of using synthetic biology and metabolic engineering methods for fine-tuning the process of soy sauce fermentation and indeed for many other natural food and beverage fermentations for improved products.",

However, its n-butanol production from lignocellulosic biomass has yet to be demonstrated. This study demonstrates the construction of a CoA-dependent acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) pathway in C. cellulovorans by introducing genes of adhE1 and ctfA-ctfB-adc from C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824, which enabled it to produce n-butanol using the abundant and low-cost agricultural waste of alkali-extracted, deshelled corn cobs (AECC) as sole carbon source. Then, a novel adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) approach was adapted to strengthen the n-butanol tolerance of C. cellulovorans, to fully utilize its n-butanol output potential. To further improve n-butanol production, both metabolic engineering and evolutionary engineering were combined, using the evolved strain as host for metabolic engineering. The n-butanol production from AECC of the engineered C. cellulovorans enhanced 138-fold from less than 0.025 g/L to 3.47 g/L. This method represents a milestone toward n-butanol production by CBP, using single recombinant clostridia.

				"abstractText": "One of the primary goals of microbial metabolic engineering is to achieve high titer, yield and productivity (TYP) of engineered strains. This TYP index requires optimized carbon flux toward desired molecule with minimal by-product formation. De novo redesign of central carbon and redox metabolism holds great promise to alleviate pathway bottleneck and improve carbon and energy utilization efficiency. The engineered strain, with the overexpression or deletion of multiple genes, typically can&rsquo;t meet the TYP index, due to overflow of central carbon and redox metabolism that compromise the final yield, despite a high titer or productivity might be achieved. To solve this challenge, we reprogramed the central carbon and redox metabolism of Bacillus subtilis and achieved high TYP production of N-acetylglucosamine. Specifically, a &ldquo;push&ndash;pull&ndash;promote&rdquo; approach efficiently reduced the overflown acetyl-CoA flux and eliminated byproduct formation. Four synthetic NAD(P)-independent metabolic routes were introduced to rewire the redox metabolism to minimize energy loss. Implementation of these genetic strategies led us to obtain a B. subtilis strain with superior TYP index. GlcNAc titer in shake flask was increased from 6.6 g L&minus;1 to 24.5 g L&minus;1, the yield was improved from 0.115 to 0.468 g GlcNAc g&minus;1 glucose, and the productivity was increased from 0.274 to 0.437 g L&minus;1 h&minus;1. These titer and yield are the highest levels ever reported and, the yield reached 98% of the theoretical pathway yield (0.478 g g&minus;1 glucose). The synthetic redesign of carbon metabolism and redox metabolism represent a novel and general metabolic engineering strategy to improve the performance of microbial cell factories.",

Folate deficiency is associated with important diseases such as cancer, anemia, cardiovascular diseases, or neural tube defects. Epidemiological data show that folate deficiency is still highly prevalent in many populations. Hence, food fortification with synthetic folic acid (i.e., folic acid supplementation) has become mandatory in many developed countries. However, folate biofortification of staple crops and dairy products as well as folate bioproduction using metabolically engineered microorganisms are promising alternatives to folic acid supplementation.

Here, we synergistically engineered the carbon metabolism and redox metabolism in the cytosol and mitochondria of a previously engineered Aspergillus oryzae to further improve the l-malate titer and decrease the byproduct succinate concentration. First, the accumulation of the intermediate pyruvate was eliminated by overexpressing a pyruvate carboxylase from Rhizopus oryzae in the cytosol and mitochondria of A.&nbsp;oryzae, and consequently, the l-malate titer increased 7.5%. Then, malate synthesis via glyoxylate bypass in the mitochondria was enhanced, and citrate synthase in the oxidative TCA cycle was downregulated by RNAi, enhancing the l-malate titer by 10.7%. Next, the exchange of byproducts (succinate and fumarate) between the cytosol and mitochondria was regulated by the expression of a dicarboxylate carrier Sfc1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the mitochondria, which increased l-malate titer 3.5% and decreased succinate concentration 36.8%. Finally, an NADH oxidase from Lactococcus lactis was overexpressed to decrease the NADH/NAD+ ratio, and the engineered A.&nbsp;oryzae strain produced 117.2 g/L l-malate and 3.8 g/L succinate, with an l-malate yield of 0.9 g/g corn starch and a productivity of 1.17 g/L/h. Our results showed that synergistic engineering of the carbon and redox metabolisms in the cytosol and mitochondria of A.&nbsp;oryzae effectively increased the l-malate titer, while simultaneously decreasing the concentration of the byproduct succinate.

				"abstractText": "Glucose and xylose are the two most abundant sugars in renewable lignocellulose sources; however, typically they cannot be simultaneously utilized due to carbon catabolite repression. N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) is a typical nutraceutical and has many applications in the field of healthcare. Here, we have developed a gene repressor system based on xylose-induced CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) in Bacillus subtilis, aimed at downregulating the expression of three genes (zwf, pfkA, glmM) that control the major competing reactions of GlcNAc synthesis (pentose phosphate pathway (HMP), glycolysis, and peptidoglycan synthesis pathway (PSP)), with the potential to relieve glucose repression and allow the co-utilization of both glucose and xylose. Simultaneous repression of these three genes by CRISPRi improved GlcNAc titer by 13.2% to 17.4 &plusmn; 0.47 g/L, with the GlcNAc yield on glucose and xylose showing an 84.1% improvement, reaching 0.42 &plusmn; 0.036 g/g. In order to further engineer the synergetic utilization of glucose and xylose, a combinatorial approach was developed based on 27 arrays containing sgRNAs with different repression capacities targeting the three genes. We further optimized the temporal control of the system and found that when 15 g/L xylose was added 6 h after inoculation, the most efficient strain, BNX122, synthesized 20.5 &plusmn; 0.85 g/L GlcNAc with a yield of 0.46 &plusmn; 0.010 g/g glucose and xylose in shake flask culture. Finally, the GlcNAc titer and productivity in a 3-L fed-batch bioreactor reached 103.1 &plusmn; 2.11 g/L and 1.17 &plusmn; 0.024 g/L/h, which were 5.0-fold and 2.7-fold of that in shake flask culture, respectively. Taken together, these findings suggest that a CRISPRi-enabled regulation method provides a simple, efficient, and universal way to promote the synergetic utilization of multiple carbon sources by microbial cell factories.",

				"abstractText": "Background:Odd chain fatty acids (odd FAs) have a wide range of applications in therapeutic and nutritional industries, as well as in chemical industries including biofuel. Yarrowia lipolytica is an oleaginous yeast considered a preferred microorganism for the production of lipid-derived biofuels and chemicals. However, it naturally produces negligible amounts of odd chain fatty acids.Results:The possibility of producing odd FAs using Y. lipolytica was investigated. Y. lipolytica wild-type strain was shown able to grow on weak acids; acetate, lactate, and propionate. Maximal growth rate on propionate reached 0.24&thinsp;&plusmn;&thinsp;0.01 h&minus;1 at 2 g/L, and growth inhibition occurred at concentration above 10 g/L. Wild-type strain accumulated lipids ranging from 7.39 to 8.14% (w/w DCW) depending on the carbon source composition, and odd FAs represented only 0.01&ndash;0.12 g/L. We here proved that the deletion of the PHD1 gene improved odd FAs production, which reached a ratio of 46.82% to total lipids. When this modification was transferred to an obese strain, engineered for improving lipid accumulation, further increase odd FAs production reaching a total of 0.57 g/L was shown. Finally, a fed-batch co-feeding strategy was optimized for further increase odd FAs production, which generated 0.75 g/L, the best production described so far in Y. lipolytica.Conclusions:A Y. lipolytica strain able to accumulate high level of odd chain fatty acids, mainly heptadecenoic acid, has been successfully developed. In addition, a fed-batch co-feeding strategy was optimized to further improve lipid accumulation and odd chain fatty acid content. These lipids enriched in odd chain fatty acid can (1) improve the properties of the biodiesel generated from Y. lipolytica lipids and (2) be used as renewable source of odd chain fatty acid for industrial applications. This work paves the way for further improvements in odd chain fatty acids and fatty acid-derived compound production.",

We investigated the glycogen metabolism of the oleaginous Y. lipolytica and found that this yeast accumulates up to 16% glycogen in its biomass. Assuming that elimination of glycogen synthesis would result in an improvement of lipid accumulation, we characterized and deleted the single gene coding for glycogen synthase, YlGSY1. The mutant was grown under lipogenic conditions with glucose and glycerol as substrates and we obtained up to 60% improvement in TAG accumulation compared to the wild type strain. Additionally, YlGSY1 was deleted in a background that was already engineered for high lipid accumulation. In this obese background, TAG accumulation was also further increased. The highest lipid content of 52% was found after 3 days of cultivation in nitrogen-limited glycerol medium. Furthermore, we constructed mutants of Y. lipolytica and S. cerevisiae that are deleted for both glycogen and TAG synthesis, demonstrating that the ability to store carbon is not essential. Overall, this work showed that glycogen synthesis is a competing pathway for TAG accumulation in oleaginous yeasts and that deletion of the glycogen synthase has beneficial effects on neutral lipid storage.",
